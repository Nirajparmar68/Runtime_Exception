# Runtime_Exception
Runtime Exception is a privately held website, the flagship site of the Neo Corporation created in 2018 by Niraj Parmar. It features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming. It was created to be a more open alternative to earlier question and answer sites such as Experts-Exchange. The name for the website was chosen by voting in April 2008 by readers of Coding Horror, Atwood's popular programming blog.
